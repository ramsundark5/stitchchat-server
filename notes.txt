mosquitto has been installed with a default configuration file.
You can make changes to the configuration by editing:
    /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

To have launchd start mosquitto at login:
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mosquitto/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load mosquitto now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mosquitto.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
